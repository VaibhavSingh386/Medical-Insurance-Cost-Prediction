# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Conducted comprehensive analysis on medical insurance datasets, focusing on key features like age, BMI, smoking 
status, and region. Preprocessed the data to ensure quality and applied feature engineering techniques for better model 
accuracy. 
Built and evaluated machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, to 
predict insurance costs with high accuracy. The Decision Tree model achieved an R² score of 0.88, 
outperforming the Linear Regression model's R² score of 0.85 by 3.5%. Optimized model performance 
through hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation, which improved prediction accuracy by 10% 
compared to baseline models.
Demonstrated the influence of key factors such as smoking status, BMI, and age on insurance costs, enabling 
stakeholders to design tailored pricing strategies and identify high-risk customer segments effectively.
